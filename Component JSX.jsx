Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

const MyComponent = function() {
  // change code below this line
 return (
    <div> Hello </div>
  );
  // change code above this line
}
/*
MyComponent should return JSX.
MyComponent should return a div element.
The div element should contain a string of text.
